#`to_camel_case`

Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words
into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only
if the original word was capitalized.

Examples:
```ruby
# returns "theStealthWarrior"
to_camel_case("the-stealth-warrior")

# returns "TheStealthWarrior"
to_camel_case("The_Stealth_Warrior")
```
